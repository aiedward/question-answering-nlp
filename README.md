Question and answering system based on natural language processing using corpus from wikipedia


Answering questions from a corpus has always been viewed as an important aspect of natural language processing. 
Given the size of Wikipedia and web in general, and the information on such websites answering questions would 
lead to building a structural and associated data. This report aims at represented how a corpus can be processed 
to accurately give answers to related questions. For this, new algorithm has been proposed.

A QA implementation, usually a computer program, may construct its answers by querying a structured 
database of knowledge or information, usually a knowledge base. More commonly, QA systems can pull 
answers from an unstructured collection of natural language documents. Here a similar attempt at 
solving the problem has been performed, where part of a article from Wikipedia has been used as corpus 
and was tested against different type of questions that the program can answer correctly. Advanced QA 
requires sophisticated text processing tools based on state-of-the-art NLP.
